# EcolibriumReef
This is an open-source, DYI aquarium controller based on Arduino. It uses an Arduino Nano to communicate and control a number of devices to help automate some basic aquarium care and maintenance. It has also been tested on an Arduino Uno R3. EcolibriumReef has gone through a number of iterations. The version I posted has a companion Android app with the same name that interfaces with the Arduino through Bluetooth serial communication. An earlier version of EcolibriumReef has an infrared interface that can be programmed using a simple remote control (a TV remote control will work) which I can also share. I am neither an expert in electronics nor a software developer. I am borrowing knowledge from GitHub as well as other shared resources and learn as I go. 
This is a work in progress. Help me improve it.
